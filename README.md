## How it works

1. Create a new Issue with the Event Form (check out the [CDC.cy example](https://github.com/cyprus-developer-community/events/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/event.yml))
2. Approve the Event on your Issue tracker
3. Let the :robot: work its :magic_wand:

## Features

### Discord Events

This is done via a [reusable GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-inputs-and-secrets-in-a-reusable-workflow) and OpenID Connect Authentication ([OICD](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/using-openid-connect-with-reusable-workflows)).

1. [Add the Discord Bot to your Server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=989117237619208233&scope=bot&permissions=8589953024)
2. Get your Server/Guild ID ("Copy ID" when Developer Mode is active in the Discord Client)
3. Copy the workflow below into your events repo (ie. `.github/workflows/gitevents-discord.yml`), see [example](https://github.com/cyprus-developer-community/events/blob/main/.github/workflows/gitevents-discord.yml)
4. Change the server-id and your default time-zone
5. Commit and push to your events repo
